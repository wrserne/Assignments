git checkout -b 

fast forward merges can only happen if there haven't been any commits
on the original branch while the new branch is being worked on

git checkout changes to another branch

git branch -D deletes a branch

merge conflicts happen when multiple commits happen and git cannot figure
out what file or folder to choose
